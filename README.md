# Disease-Speciality-Recommendation

This project uses a classification model to predict diseases based on symptoms, providing valuable insights for specialist doctors. It outputs the predicted disease, its likelihood, the recommended doctor to consult, and a brief description of the disease. This helps doctors make informed decisions for further evaluation and treatment. The model acts as a diagnostic tool, aiding in the identification of potential diseases and the appropriate specialist to visit. The project ultimately enhances decision-making in medical practice by aligning disease predictions with expert recommendations.
